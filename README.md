Calibration and Montecarlo for Additive Processes
•The calibration at different dates of σt, kt and ηt, that characterize Additive Tempered Stable processes, a general- ization of Lévy Normal Tempered Stable processes involving time-dependent parameters;
•The simulation of ATS processes exploiting a Monte Carlo technique, based on the numerical inversion of the cumu- lative distribution function of process increments, in order to price plain vanilla European call options;
•The pricing of a Sprint Autocallable Put Option (an exotic path-dependent derivative) with the underlying stock price simulated as above.
